Think of it as “Match Site” meets “Review Site”.<br/>www.aBetterOpinion.com works in a two-step process. First, users rate the things they’ve seen, read or played. The more they rate, the better the site works for them and everyone else. Next, when they search for an opinion on a specific product, the website sorts the available reviews based on who shares their same tastes. It even narrows the matching to within the genre searched, really giving them targeted matches.<br/>Another powerful feature is the ability to receive general recommendations. Again, the site will find a user’s best matches and display those matches’ favorite products.
